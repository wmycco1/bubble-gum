=== NOTES & ASSUMPTIONS ===

Revenue Model
1. Free plan: 40% of users stay free forever
2. Starter plan ($29/mo): 35% of paying customers
3. Pro plan ($49/mo): 20% of paying customers  
4. Enterprise plan ($99/mo): 5% of paying customers
5. Annual plans get 16% discount (equivalent to 2 months free)
6. Weighted ARPU = $35/month across all paying tiers

Growth Assumptions
1. Aggressive customer acquisition in Years 1-3 (viral + paid marketing)
2. Growth slows in Years 4-5 as market saturates
3. Churn stabilizes at 3.5% monthly (35% annually)
4. Conversion from free to paid = 15% (industry benchmark)

Cost Structure
1. Personnel is largest cost (75%+ of expenses)
2. Infrastructure scales linearly with customers (cloud-native)
3. AI API costs = $2.25 per customer per month (blended rate)
4. Marketing spend = $71-132 CAC (varies by channel efficiency)

Critical Risks
1. Business is NOT profitable in 5-year window without additional funding
2. Cumulative losses exceed $32M by Year 5
3. Need Series A ($8M) by Month 18 to avoid running out of cash
4. High burn rate requires continuous fundraising
5. LTV:CAC ratio degrades in later years (market saturation)

Success Requirements
1. Must raise Series A ($8M) by Month 18
2. Must achieve $2M ARR before Series A
3. Must reduce CAC by 30%+ through organic/viral growth
4. Must increase ARPU by 20%+ through upselling/enterprise
5. Alternative: Achieve profitability through team reduction + cost cuts


=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

Strategic Priorities
1. Focus on achieving $2M ARR by Month 18 to secure Series A
2. Optimize CAC through content marketing and viral loops
3. Increase ARPU through feature-based pricing and enterprise sales
4. Reduce churn through better onboarding and customer success
5. Consider profitability path: slower growth, leaner team

Fundraising Strategy
1. Seed round ($2M) - Complete (Month 0)
2. Series A ($8M) - Target Month 18 at $2M ARR valuation ~$20M
3. Series B ($20M) - Target Month 36 at $10M ARR valuation ~$80M
4. Alternative: Bridge round ($2M) at Month 12 if growth slower than expected

Path to Profitability (Alternative Strategy)
1. Reduce team size from 22 to 12 in Year 2 (saves $1.5M/year)
2. Cut marketing spend by 50% and focus on organic growth
3. Target break-even at Month 30 instead of hyper-growth
4. Slower but sustainable: profitable by Year 3 at $5M ARR
